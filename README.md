# Discord-Bot

> This Discord bot allows for users to type in discord chat to see their League of Legends, along side with some other fun commands I wanted to add. 

The League of Legends data is supported by the Riot API, using their updated datasets to display the stats the bot outputs. This is seen in the ranked_finder.py file.


- `$league <username>` : outputs the users solo/duo rank, ranked flex rank, latest game champion and KDA, and wins/losts of their last 10 games

- `$webtoon` or `$wt`: outputs a random webtoon with its title, cover art, rating, and a summary of the plot
